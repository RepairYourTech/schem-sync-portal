Based on the emails from Google Drive Safety received between January 28 and January 29, 2026, I found a series of notifications flagging files for violating the "Malware and Similar Malicious Content policy."

Although you mentioned 27 emails, the notifications I retrieved list 18 unique files. Several files generated multiple notifications (duplicates), which likely accounts for the higher email count.
