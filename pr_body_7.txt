## Summary
This PR fixes the sync panel layout issues reported in #7.

### Changes
- Fixed height budgeting in `SyncPortal.tsx` to respect terminal height and app footer.
- Added responsive overheads for panels in narrow widths.

- Ensured controls and stats remain visible even during queue overflow.

### Verification
- `bun run lint` passed.
- `bun test` passed all 159 tests.
- Manual verification of layout behavior in various terminal sizes.
