    "situation": "User requested zero-defect audit and fix for Sync Portal focus/alignment. Recurring issues with focus states and alignment in panels.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete manual audit and failure to propagate 'onSubFocusIndexChange' through nested panel components. Initial reliance on 'patterns.md' without deep verification against 'Dashboard.tsx'.",
    "solution": "1. Standardized panel heights to fixed values (22 wide, 20 narrow) when running. 2. Propagated 'onSubFocusIndexChange' through DownsyncPanel, LocalShieldPanel, and UpsyncPanel to PanelHeader. 3. Used 'colors.success' for focus states as per Dashboard.tsx pattern.",
    "lesson": "CRITICAL: For 'Zero Defect' or recurring issues, perform a line-by-line file audit. Cross-reference working components like Dashboard.tsx to verify prop naming (e.g., _onSubFocusIndexChange vs onSubFocusIndexChange) and event handling. Do not trust grep alone for propagation audits.",
