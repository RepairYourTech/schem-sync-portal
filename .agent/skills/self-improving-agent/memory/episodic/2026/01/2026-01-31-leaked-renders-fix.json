  "situation": "TUI application crashed with 'Text must be created inside of a text node' because a logical expression evaluated to 0.",
  "root_cause": "OpenTUI CliRenderer does not handle raw numeric children in its reconciler efficiently; it tries to render them as text nodes but fails if they aren't properly wrapped or stringified. JSX expressions like {count && <Component />} leak the value 0 when count is 0.",
  "solution": "1. Replace logical && with ternary operators or double-negation (!!). 2. Explicitly stringify numeric children using String() or template literals. 3. Enable react/jsx-no-leaked-render ESLint rule.",
  "lesson": "Always treat numeric children as dangerous in TUI environments. Prefer explicit string conversion and ternary conditional rendering.",
